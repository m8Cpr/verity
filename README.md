# Verity encounter solver

Minimal project built for solving the Verity encounter puzzle in Salvation's Edge raid from Destiny 2.

Built with Vite + React, implementing:

- [@twbs/fantasticon](https://github.com/twbs/fantasticon) A forked version of the Fantasticon library by the bootstrap folks, that solves a problem related to the glob getFileDirectory method.
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) No fancy presentation needed for the goat.
